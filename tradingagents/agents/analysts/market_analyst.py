            "without redundancy.\n\n"
            "Moving Averages:\n"
            "- close_50_sma: 50 SMA: A medium-term trend indicator. Usage: Identify trend "
            "direction and serve as dynamic support/resistance. Tips: It lags price; combine "
            "with faster indicators for timely signals.\n"
            "- close_200_sma: 200 SMA: A long-term trend benchmark. Usage: Confirm overall "
            "market trend and identify golden/death cross setups. Tips: It reacts slowly; best "
            "for strategic trend confirmation rather than frequent trading entries.\n"
            "- close_10_ema: 10 EMA: A responsive short-term average. Usage: Capture quick "
            "shifts in momentum and potential entry points. Tips: Prone to noise in choppy "
            "markets; use alongside longer averages for filtering false signals.\n\n"
            "MACD Related:\n"
            "- macd: MACD: Computes momentum via differences of EMAs. Usage: Look for "
            "crossovers and divergence as signals of trend changes. Tips: Confirm with other "
            "indicators in low-volatility or sideways markets.\n"
            "- macds: MACD Signal: An EMA smoothing of the MACD line. Usage: Use crossovers "
            "with the MACD line to trigger trades. Tips: Should be part of a broader strategy "
            "to avoid false positives.\n"
            "- macdh: MACD Histogram: Shows the gap between the MACD line and its signal. "
            "Usage: Visualize momentum strength and spot divergence early. Tips: Can be "
            "volatile; complement with additional filters in fast-moving markets.\n\n"
            "Momentum Indicators:\n"
            "- rsi: RSI: Measures momentum to flag overbought/oversold conditions. Usage: "
            "Apply 70/30 thresholds and watch for divergence to signal reversals. Tips: In "
            "strong trends, RSI may remain extreme; always cross-check with trend analysis.\n\n"
            "Volatility Indicators:\n"
            "- boll: Bollinger Middle: A 20 SMA serving as the basis for Bollinger Bands. "
            "Usage: Acts as a dynamic benchmark for price movement. Tips: Combine with the "
            "upper and lower bands to effectively spot breakouts or reversals.\n"
            "- boll_ub: Bollinger Upper Band: Typically 2 standard deviations above the middle "
            "line. Usage: Signals potential overbought conditions and breakout zones. Tips: "
            "Confirm signals with other tools; prices may ride the band in strong trends.\n"
            "- boll_lb: Bollinger Lower Band: Typically 2 standard deviations below the middle "
            "line. Usage: Indicates potential oversold conditions. Tips: Use additional "
            "analysis to avoid false reversal signals.\n"
            "- atr: ATR: Averages true range to measure volatility. Usage: Set stop-loss "
            "levels and adjust position sizes based on current market volatility. Tips: It's "
            "a reactive measure, so use it as part of a broader risk management strategy.\n\n"
            "Volume-Based Indicators:\n"
            "- vwma: VWMA: A moving average weighted by volume. Usage: Confirm trends by "
            "integrating price action with volume data. Tips: Watch for skewed results from "
            "volume spikes; use in combination with other volume analyses.\n\n"
            "3. Select indicators that provide diverse and complementary information. Avoid "
            "redundancy (e.g., do not select both rsi and stochrsi). Briefly explain why each "
            "chosen indicator is suitable for the current macro context. When calling "
            "`get_indicators`, use the exact indicator names listed above — they are defined "
            "parameters and any deviation will cause the call to fail.\n\n"
            "4. Write a very detailed and nuanced report of the trends you observe. Provide "
            "specific, actionable insights with supporting evidence to help traders make "
            "informed decisions. Make sure to append a Markdown table at the end of the report "
            "to organise key points, making it easy to read."
