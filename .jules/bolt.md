## 2024-05-24 - [Avoid Pandas Vectorized String Operations on Tiny Arrays]
**Learning:** While `df.columns.astype(str).str.lower()` is faster for large datasets (e.g., 1000+ columns), it is actually a micro-deoptimization for typical DataFrames with few columns. The overhead of pandas' `.str` accessor dispatch and Index object creation outweighs the raw iteration speed of a simple Python list comprehension `[str(c).lower() for c in df.columns]`.
**Action:** Do not replace list comprehensions with pandas vectorized string accessors when the array size is known to be very small (like DataFrame columns), unless the number of columns is explicitly known to be massive.

## 2024-05-25 - [Avoid stdlib statistics for math ops on performance-critical code]
**Learning:** The Python standard library `statistics` module (e.g., `statistics.mean`, `statistics.stdev`, `statistics.pvariance`) has significant overhead compared to simple built-in math operations (like `sum()` and generator expressions). Benchmarks showed an ~10x-14x performance improvement when replacing `statistics` functions with simple, pure-Python implementations using `sum()` and `len()`.
**Action:** When performing calculations in performance-sensitive areas (like portfolio risk evaluation over many ticks/prices), use built-in operations rather than the `statistics` module.

## 2024-05-26 - [Single-pass statistical metrics computation]
**Learning:** Calculating statistical metrics like Variance, Standard Deviation, Covariance, Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, and Beta typically requires multiple passes over arrays when implemented naively (e.g., one pass to calculate mean, a second pass to calculate variance/covariance). Converting these into single-pass O(N) pure-math implementations (maintaining running sums of x, y, x*y, x*x, y*y) eliminates intermediate list allocations, reduces array iterations, and provides a >50% performance improvement on large arrays while matching numerical accuracy.
**Action:** When calculating complex statistical indicators across loops, combine the sum variables in a single iteration instead of multiple generator expressions or loops.
